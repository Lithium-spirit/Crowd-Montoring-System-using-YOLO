This project is an object detection model with a frontend based on a template.\
Its specific use case is to be deployed in various sports courts to detect and estimate the crowd presence at any given instant which could be useful information for those wanting to play the game on the same court.\
We have also included compatibility with the standard yolo11 model to broaden its scope and hence its possible deployment opportunities.
